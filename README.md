# üõ°Ô∏è Audit Repository  

This repository is dedicated to the **storage of smart contract audits** performed by our team. Each PDF contains a detailed report on identified vulnerabilities, tests conducted, and mitigation recommendations.  

## üìù Description  

- **File Format**:  
  All audit reports are provided in **PDF** format for ease of reading and sharing.  

- **Technologies Audited**:  
  The audited projects include smart contracts written in **Solidity**, with accompanying test scripts in **JavaScript** and **TypeScript** when applicable.  

- **Tools Used During the Audits**:  
  - [**Slither**](https://github.com/crytic/slither): Static analysis for identifying vulnerabilities in Solidity contracts.  
  - [**Hardhat**](https://hardhat.org/): Development and testing framework for smart contracts.  
  - [**Echidna**](https://github.com/crytic/echidna): Fuzzing tool for advanced property-based testing.  
  - [**Foundry**](https://getfoundry.sh/): Comprehensive toolkit for Solidity development and testing, including fuzzing.  
  - [**MythX**](https://mythx.io/): Cloud-based security analysis for Ethereum contracts.  
  - [**Pandoc**](https://pandoc.org/): Document converter for formatting and compiling reports.  
  - [**Forge**](https://book.getfoundry.sh/): A testing framework within Foundry for running Solidity tests and property invariants.  

## üìÅ Repository Structure  

The following are links to the individual GitHub repositories where specific project audits and associated materials can be found:  

- **Audit PasswordStore**: [GitHub Repository](https://github.com/AlbertoGuirado/PasswordStore)
- **Audit PuppyRaffle**: [GitHub Repository](https://github.com/AlbertoGuirado/PuppyRaffle) 
- **Audit ThunderLoan**: [GitHub Repository](https://github.com/AlbertoGuirado/ThunderLoanAudit)  
- **Audit TSwapProtocol**: [GitHub Repository](https://github.com/AlbertoGuirado/Solidity-TSwapProtocol-Audit)
- **Audit L1BossBridge**: [GitHub Repository](https://github.com/AlbertoGuirado/L1BossBridge)

Each repository contains additional resources, such as auxiliary test scripts, tools, and any custom configurations used during the audit.  

## üö© Types of Projects and Topics Covered  

The audits performed include a wide variety of blockchain-based projects and advanced security topics, such as:  

- **Flashloans**: Evaluation of flashloan mechanisms and their potential for abuse.  
- **Liquidity Pools**: Analysis of pool mechanics, fee structures, and vulnerabilities.  
- **Reentrancy**: Identification of reentrancy attack vectors and mitigations.  
- **Invariants Testing**: Validation of key invariants to ensure protocol robustness.  
- **MEVs (Maximal Extractable Value)**: Assessment of strategies to mitigate risks related to MEVs.  
- **Aderyn**: Security evaluation of decentralized solutions built using Aderyn.  
- **Polygon**: Audits focusing on contracts deployed on the Polygon network or interacting with it.  

## üö© Notes  

- Each PDF report is organized into detailed sections, including vulnerability descriptions, impact analysis, tests performed, and recommended mitigations.  
- This repository **does not include the source code or test cases** used during the audits, but only the documented findings.
